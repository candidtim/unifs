# To do

 - Add a "word of caution" and a confirmation at first start.
 - Build a list of known supported protocols when releasing the application,
   embed it into the documentation, to help users install and configure the
   app.
 - Later, implement a feature in the app to install the missing packages,
   instead of asking the user to install them. (E.g., consider users that do
   not have experience with Python).
 - Provide configuration examples of the most commonly-used file systems.
 - Later, implement interactive `conf` sub-commands to add other file systems.
 - Much later, distribute with `brew`, consider other distributions.
